### What I've done today?

  - I answered questions in Team Task, the questions are above here.
  - **Q2. The router for express.js is middleware. What is the principle behind implementing the router with the middleware?**
      
      Why do we use middleware?

      - Middleware can executes anyÂ code
      - We can make changes to the request-response objects
      - Middleware can also End the request-response cycle
      - Middleware can call the next middleware function in a stack

      We use these functions to modify our middleware to perform many tasks. 
      > ***If we want to block our site for some country or if we're going to check the authentication of a user etc., we use middleware for that.***
      > 

      Implementing a middleware application allows developers to integrate operating systems and hardware with the wide variety of various applications that are currently available. 

      > ***Simply put, middleware is built to connect one set of code to another set of code, and without this tech, our digital landscape would be very different from what we know it.***
