## What did you learn today ?

- So far, I can say that I finally understand a bit of this material. I can say that I understand about React material as a Beginner.
Such as : ```create react-app...``` | ```yarn ...``` syntax.

- I said before that I was lacking understand React at the first. But after several tried and learnt more about this material, I finally can understand it, and finish my mini-test.

- I submited my personal task and my minitest.

## What did you do well?

I finished my minitest and deployed it. I am so proud of myself, on last day of this week, I finally can understand even just a bit of it.

## What needs to improve?

### Problem

I took kinda long time to finish my minitest, cus I am still trying understand React and Javascript.

### Action

I need to learn more and more to improve my knowledge about React.js
