## What did you learn today ?



## What did you do well?

So far, I dun know :")

At least I am trying to still alive and listen to all of the bootcamp leader, mentor, and my teammates explanations.

Huhu TT, Cus I am still lacking to understand this Framework :(, so I can't help others or give any feedback.

## What needs to improve?

### Problem

Acrtually I am still lacking to undestand this framework until now TT.

### Action

I need more focus time to learn again about the React and Javascript. :'(
Tomorrow I need to reply about the React modul so I cam understand more than now.

#### Documentation for today

- I had a mini-test
  

- We had a discussion about the personal task, how to solve the react problem

- We had a mentoring time with Mr. Justin and Mr. Aditya
