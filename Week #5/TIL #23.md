## Introduction

Today I feel much better than yesterday. 
I feel like I need to improve more and more about my skill, cus it's already almost in the mid of the bootcamp.

## What did I learn today ?

- First session, we had a special guest from TeamSparta, they are Aron and Sang-Eon.
  My connection was fine, that's why I can attend the first session BUT with my Phone XD.
