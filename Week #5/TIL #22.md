## Introduction

Still with the same condition like yesterday, I hope I could attend in all session.
Like what I've told yesterday, we had a good progress.
And tomorrow is my turn to finishing the display.

## What did I learn today ?

Today actually we have session with Ms. Eunseo, but cus my bad condition,
I couldn't attend to that session again like yesterday. I am trying to open the ZEP, but it didn't work well.

## My Goal

I hope my team can finish the project asap. :)
