## Introduce🤗

Well, for the introduce. I wanna to say that today I started my day earlier? I'd say
I started my day with had a breakfast first, cus this is the important thing to start my day. XD
My fav food for breakfast usually Soup Base, like Sop, Soto, etc 🥘🍲🍵.
I got WhatsApp notification from my Team Leader, and he asked us to live on ZEP.
Well I live on ZEP, but still my connection was so bad, so I got the lower ranking on the first day 😔.
