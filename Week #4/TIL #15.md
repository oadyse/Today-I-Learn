## What I've done today?

Actually I wasn't in a good condition today. I am trying to attended the class this night.
Well for the first time, I even could attended the preparation class with Ms. Eunseo, we started with a game.
And then We had a zoom session with Mr. Justin.

In the middle of Mr. Justion session, I felt worse, and i decided to take a break. So today, I even couldn't meet my new teammates ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜£.
