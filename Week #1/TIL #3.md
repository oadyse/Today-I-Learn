# Today-I-Learn #3

October 19th, 2022

## Introduce🤗

Today, I am trying to stay in ZEP since morning, since I woke up, while I am doing my side job.
And I can meet my team and another friend there. 🎀

## Team progress for today

Well, we almost finish and already made a progress for our project.
I am so happy we had this progress XD

## What you have completed today

* Finally I can deploy the app 😎
* I made a slide for presentation 💻
* I had a progress for the project

## New things that you’ve learned / error

Well, actually I found some errors like Apllication error while I deployed it. But I solved that finally.

So, It was error when I waas trying to push to the Heroku. Cus We already push our project to Github. 

The solution is I push the changes to Github first and then I push it to the Heroku, and Voilaaa It shown :D

## My reflection (what you did great, what you need to improve)

#### #What I did great😁

* I met a new friend today😊
